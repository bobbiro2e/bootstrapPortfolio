                        <p>Hey, my name is Bobbi Rose Lanser currently a student in Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. I guess
                            I'll start from the beginning. I spent my first eighteen years on a rural farm in Nebraska. People
                            generally have a few follow-up questions after that statement so I'll go ahead and answer the
                            FAQs. I lived twenty miles down gravel roads from the nearest town and sixty miles from the nearest
                            city. "Town" includes the high-school, a gas station, and a population of 900 people. "City"
                            includes Wal-Mart, Target, and the lamest mall you've ever seen. Our farmland is about 5 square
                            miles or 3,200 acres, and most of my family lives on our land. We grow corn and soybeans and
                            raise pigs and cows. It is a humbling lifestyle, and I wouldn't change my upbringing for the
                            world.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-5">
                        <p>But, I knew since age nine my future lied beyond that 5 miles. At eighteen I packed up my things
                            and moved to, the big city, as they call it on the farm. Chicago is my adopted home and I love
                            it with all my heart. I truly believe it is the most beautiful city in the world. Right now I
                            live on the northside in Lakeview-East. Just before beginning camp I was bartending and serving
                            at a couple bars in Wrigleyville, including Cubby Bear and Sluggers. It was an interesting career,
                            to say the least. Still, it's those same degrading experiences that are the sole reason I decided
                            to transform my predicted dim fate and join this program. Now, I absolutely know I am doing exactly
                            what I need to do for an incredibly bright future.</p>
